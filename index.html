                 <h3>A picture is worth a thousand words</h3>
                    <p>Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you what can be improved but also make revamps to the most critical parts of the design. 
                    </p>
                <h3>Design Report </h3>
                    <p>We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and provide a detailed visual report with useful tips and design hacks. This would be the starting point for further work on the design.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Ways to redisgn</h3>
                    <p>We provide several strategies for further redesign by various contractors, from freelancers to high-end agencies. We provide you with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full redesign and quick but effective improvements.</p>
